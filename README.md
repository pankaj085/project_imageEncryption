Image Encryption Tool

This project is a simple yet effective file encryption and decryption application designed to protect sensitive files. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy operation and uses the cryptography library to ensure secure encryption with the Fernet algorithm. Key features include:

File Encryption/Decryption:
Encrypt or decrypt any selected file using a password.

Password Protection:
The password generates a unique key for file encryption, ensuring that only the correct password can decrypt the file.

User-Friendly Interface:
Built with Tkinter, the app offers an intuitive layout for selecting files, entering passwords, and performing encryption or decryption tasks.

Status Updates:
Clear feedback on whether a file is encrypted or decrypted, and prompts for password input.

Threading:Implements threading for smooth UI interaction during encryption or decryption processes.

This project provides a straightforward solution for anyone needing to protect their data from unauthorized access.
